# {**PROJECT_NAME**}

Template for Typescript Repositories

This project follows the [scripts to rule them all](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all) convention.

## Initial bootstrap

Once the repository is created, there is a `Initial bootstrapping` action that will run and replace all placeholders
with the correct values. It will also create a new commit with the changes.

## Local dev

Please use [developer-machine](https://github.com/turo/developer-machine) to install core development tooling.

```shell
~/code/developer-machine
./install frontend
```

To setup the project, simply run:

```bash
./script/setup
```

## Running the tests

Run the tests

```bash
./script/test
```

## GitHub Workflows

The supported workflows for GitHub are found in files in the `.github/workflows` directory.

### Sync environment from template repo Workflow

The `sync-environment.yaml` file from the `global` directory should have been moved up to this directory
to properly establish the "Sync environment from template repo" workflow. This workflow
is intended to be run on a periodic basis and copies certain files from the typescript-template repo
into derivative repositories, those repositories created by using typescript-template as its template
at GitHub repository creation time. This allows desired changes to typescript-template to be propagated to
all of its derivative repos.

### CI Workflow

This workflow to accomplish standard CI tasks for Pull Requests (PR).

### Release Workflow

This workflow to accomplish standard Releasing of a derivative repository upon merge of a PR to the
default branch.
